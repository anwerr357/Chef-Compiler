Recipe Health Analyzer Compiler

This academic project develops a specialized compiler for recipe analysis that evaluates whether a recipe meets healthy dietary standards. The compiler processes recipe inputs by verifying required components such as ingredients, recipe name, and preparation steps.

Using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) with ply.lex and ply.yacc, the system parses and compiles recipes into a structured format. After compilation, the enhanced recipe is regenerated with additional analytics, leveraging OpenAI's ChatCompletion API to assess nutritional value and determine if the dish qualifies as healthy based on predefined criteria.

Key features:

Lexical & syntactic analysis of recipe structure

Validation of mandatory recipe components

AI-powered health assessment with detailed analytics

Clear output formatting with health insights

This project demonstrates the application of compiler design principles in an innovative, health-focused context.
